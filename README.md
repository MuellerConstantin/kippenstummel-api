## Introduction

This is the backend API for Kippenstummel. It is a simple API that contains
the necessary endpoints and application logic of the platform.

## Deployment

Kippenstummel API is generally operated on-premise. There are a few steps to
follow for installation: Firstly, the appropriate system environment with its
third-party services must be set up (See [Operation](docs/operation.md)) and secondly,
the application must be correctly configured (See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md)).
After that, Kippenstummel API can then be started and operated on-premise, optionally
scaled horizontally.
