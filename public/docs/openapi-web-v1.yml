  title: Kippenstummel - Web API
  version: v1
  description: |
    Kippenstummel is a service that allows smokers to quickly and easily find nearby
    cigarette vending machines. Users can report, rate, and retrieve the locations of
    cigarette vending machines. This is the documentation of Kippenstummel's Web API, a
    RESTful interface.

    # General

    The web interface is an open-access, HTTP-based RESTful interface. The concepts
    discussed in this section apply to the entire interface. Although the interface is
    publicly accessible, separate regulations apply, particularly to its use by third
    parties. Therefore, please familiarize yourself with the terms of use and legal
    requirements before using the interface.

    ## HTTP Verbs

    The API generally uses HTTP verbs to control the various operations. Depending on the
    verb, a specific operation is assumed. The following table clearly clarifies their
    use and meaning within the API.

    | Verb         | Description                                                       |
    |--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | HEAD         | Used for retrieving metadata of resources.                        |
    | GET          | Used for retrieving resources.                                    |
    | POST         | Used for creating resources.                                      |
    | PATCH        | Used for updating resources partially.                            |
    | PUT          | Used for replacing resources.                                     |
    | DELETE       | Used for deleting resources.                                      |

    ## Content Negotiation

    Unless otherwise specified, this API always expects and sends resources as
    `application/json`. Content negotiation, hence requesting resources in alternative
    representations, is not supported.

    ## Timestamps

    Timestamps are returned in [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html)
    format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sss`. The time stamp is always specified in zulu time
    (UTC). A corresponding time zone indication is attached.

    ## Pagination

    Some of the queries read from a larger subset of the data. In these cases,
    pagination is used to avoid performance problems. In general, the pagination
    behaviour is controlled by the query parameters `page`, the page index, and
    `perPage`, the page size. Please note that not all endpoints/resources support
    pagination.

    ```
    ?page=0&perPage=30
    ```

    >[!note]
    >The offset numbering is zero-based. Omitting the offset parameter sets the
    >requested page to zero by default and returns the first X elements of a
    >collection. Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 25
    >items by default.

    ## Filtering

    Some endpoints support filtering of the results. To filter the results, the RSQL
    query language is used in combination with the HTTP query parameter `filter`.

    ```
    ?filter="score>=5"
    ```

    >[!note]
    >When filtering a collection, not all fields of a Data Transfer Object (DTO)
    >necessarily have to be supported. In individual cases, only a subset of the
    >available fields may be supported. This also applies to the available operators,
    >some might not be supported for certain properties.

    ## Error Handling

    All endpoints of the API return a well-defined error response in case of an
    error. This error response contains among others the `code` field which
    indicates the exact type of the error, in case the HTTP status code does not
    provide enough information. The following error codes are used combined with
    the HTTP status code:

    | Error Code                       | Status Code | Description                   |
    |----------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
    | `INTERNAL_ERROR`                 | 500         | Internal error occured        |
    | `NOT_FOUND_ERROR`                | 404         | Resource not found            |
    | `INVALID_PAYLOAD_ERROR`          | 422         | Payload validation failed     |

    | `THROTTLED_ERROR`                | 429         | The action was throttled      |
    | `INCONSISTENT_READ_MODEL_ERROR`  | 500         | Inconsistent read model       |

    ### Error Details

    For some errors, additional details are provided in the `details` field. The following
    error types have additional details:

    - `INVALID_PAYLOAD_ERROR`
    - `UNSUPPORTED_FILTER_FIELD_ERROR`

    ## Authentication

    The platform does not require user account registration. Accordingly, there is no
    authentication in the traditional sense. However, in certain cases, such as submitting
    or changing locations, or rating, authentication in the technical sense is required.

    Instead of registering with their personal information, the user is issued an anonymous
    identity consisting of an identifier and a secret. All user interactions are linked to
    this anonymous identity, and the user can also authenticate themselves to the system
    using these anonymous credentials.

    ```
    Identity: 69fcc159-c25f-4c2a-8df8-3a492cfe007c
    Secret: d63a47e5b5c2a5477c384a7e007aa4a276e28e1e2f33ea027eb66e16acb3bfbe49694e44259bde20da74ae4e82138d1bcfd8771d7b96220bbebfc5d59b8fb79a
    ```

    After receiving the anonymous credentials, the authentication flow essentially follows
    the classic procedure. In exchange for a valid anonymous identity, which requires the
    submission of the identifier and secret, the user is issued a JWT access token. This
    token is used for all subsequent authentication requests. For this purpose, the *HTTP
    Bearer Authentication* schema and the `Authorization` header are used.

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>
    ```

    ## Challenge-Response Mechanisms

    This platform uses a number of challenge-response mechanisms to prevent abuse and
    ensure the security of the system. The following mechanisms are used:

    - Proof-of-Work (PoW)
    - Captcha

    ### Proof-of-Work (PoW)

    PoW is a computational challenge-response mechanism that requires the client to solve a
    mathematical problem in order to prove that they are not a robot. The difficulty of the
    problem is set by the server and is determined by the number of leading zeros in the
    hash of the challenge itself. The server will provide the challenge in the following
    format:

    ```
    <difficulty>:<expiresAt>:<algorithm>:<nonce>[:<counter>]
    ```

    The client's task is to find a value (often called a counter or solution) which, when
    appended to the challenge and hashed with the specified algorithm (e.g. SHA-256), produces
    a hash with the required number of leading zeros defined by the `difficulty`.

    ### Captcha

    Captcha is a visual challenge-response mechanism that requires the user to solve a
    simple visual challenge. The server will generate a short alphanumeric string and
    embedd it into an image. The user is then presented with the image and asked to
    enter the string into a text field.
